	<p>Number of builds that can be stuck in the queue before they start getting canceled.</p>

		Say you're running low on executors, so you want to limit the number of queued builds that have the same BRANCH parameter.
		This value will only allow the specified number of builds in the queue that have the same BRANCH parameter (or whatever parameter specified).
