	<p>Number of builds that can be running before they start getting blocked in the queue.</p>
	<p>
		Say you're running low on executors, so you want to limit the number of builds that have the same BRANCH parameter.
		This value will only allow the specified number of running builds that have the same BRANCH parameter (or whatever parameter specified).
