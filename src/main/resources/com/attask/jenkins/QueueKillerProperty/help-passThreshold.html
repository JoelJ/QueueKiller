	<p>
		Used as a short-circuit to prevent iterating more finished builds than we need to.
		This is the number of finished builds allowed in a row before it is assumed there are no more running jobs.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you find that you only ever have 3Â finished jobs in between running jobs, this value should be 3 or 4.
		However, if you find that you often have a lot of newer builds finish before older jobs, this should be a higher value.

		The default is 10.
