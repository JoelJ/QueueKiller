<div>
	<div>The parameters you want to keep when a build is throttled and removed from the queue.</div>

	<div>
		For example: say your build is triggered by an SCM hook which passes in the commit range that will be run.
		When an older build is throttled and removed from the queue, you don't want to lose the bottom number of the
		range to be run.
		So would specify the OLD_REV value here, to keep the oldest OLD_REV.
	</div>

	<div>
		Example configuration. Job parameters:
		<ul>
			<li>ID</li>
			<li>BRANCH</li>
			<li>OLD_REV</li>
			<li>NEW_REV</li>
		</ul>
		A job is triggered with the following values and starts running:
		<ul>
			<li>ID: 1</li>
			<li>BRANCH: master</li>
			<li>OLD_REV: 1</li>
			<li>NEW_REV: 2</li>
		</ul>
		Another job gets scheduled:
		<ul>
			<li>ID: 2</li>
			<li>BRANCH: master</li>
			<li>OLD_REV: 2</li>
			<li>NEW_REV: 3</li>
		</ul>
		but the BRANCH value is being throttled, so it sits in the queue. <br/>

		And then once more another job is scheduled:
		<ul>
			<li>ID: 3</li>
			<li>BRANCH: master</li>
			<li>OLD_REV: 3</li>
			<li>NEW_REV: 4</li>
		</ul>
		However, the queue is throttling, so job with ID "2" will be canceled. However, OLD_REV is set to be copied.
		So the build with ID: "3" will change it's OLD_REV to be the same value of OLD_REV of ID "2",
		the build with ID "2" will be canceled, and the build with ID "3" would end up looking like this:
		<ul>
			<li>ID: 3</li>
			<li>BRANCH: master</li>
			<li>OLD_REV: 2</li>
			<li>NEW_REV: 4</li>
		</ul>
		This is especially useful if your <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JoelJ/SimpleGit/blob/master/README.md">SCM plugin</a>
		allows you to specify the commit range for generating the Change History.
